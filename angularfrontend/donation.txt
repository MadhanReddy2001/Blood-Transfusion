Giving blood
Most people are able to give blood, but a lot fewer people than are needed to meet demand actually do.

You can usually donate blood if you:

are fit and healthy
weigh between 50kg (7st 12lb) and 158kg (25st)
are 17 to 65 years old

// Blood transfusion
If you have a blood transfusion 
(where blood is taken from one person and given to another) 
your blood will be tested against a sample of donor cells that contain ABO and RhD antigens. 
If there's no reaction, donor blood with the same ABO and RhD type can be used.
